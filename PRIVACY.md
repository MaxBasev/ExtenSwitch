This Privacy Policy describes how ExtenSwitch ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension "ExtenSwitch" (the "Product").

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, share, or sell your personal data.** 

The Product functions entirely locally on your device. It interacts with Chrome's APIs solely to perform its core functionality: managing your installed extensions.

### 1.1. Chrome Permissions
The Product utilizes the following permissions for functional purposes only:
*   **`management`**: Used to read the list of installed extensions and toggle their enabled/disabled status. This processing happens instantly on your device.
*   **`storage`**: Used to save your local preferences (e.g., your "Profiles/Snapshots" and UI settings) locally on your browser using `chrome.storage.local`. This data never leaves your device and is not synced to our servers.

## 2. Third-Party Services

The Product does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, tracking tools, or advertising networks. No data is sent to external servers.

## 3. Data Security

Since we do not collect any data, there is no personal data to be breached or stolen from our servers. Your settings stored locally in your browser are protected by your browser's security mechanisms.
