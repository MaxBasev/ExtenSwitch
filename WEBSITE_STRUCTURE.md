# Website Structure for ExtenSwitch

This document outlines the proposed structure for the official ExtenSwitch product website. The goal is to drive installations and build trust (especially for the Privacy Policy requirement).

*   **Visual**: High-quality screenshot or mockups of the extension popup (showing the new Profiles UI).

## 3. "The Problem" Section

    *   Too many icons in the toolbar?
